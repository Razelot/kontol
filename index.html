          <p>This is the very first portfolio I ever made. Because I am a Computer Engineering major, I found like having a tech-like visual was appealing as my very first design.
            My inspiration for this design comes from numerous sci-fi films such as "The Matrix".
            Some elements such as skill bars were also inpired by the numerous role-playing video games which I played.

              I grew up in a small island in Indonesia called "Bali".
              Being able to live at a tropical paradise was something which I took for granted when I was little.
              Some of the things that miss include riding my bike next to the beach and eating the local cuisine.

              Sometimes I like to doodle during my free time. I've always enjoyed being able to express my imaginations in the form of pictures or drawings.
              Learning to manipulate digital images have opened new possibilities for me.
              I find that that coming up with eye catching designs pleases me and I sometimes take extra time to pay attention to finer details.

                        <p>This project was made during the first software engineering class I had ever taken.
                          There were many things that were new to me at the time - Having to work with a large group of ten as well as having to independently researching the technology that we planned to use.
                          Written in <strong>Ruby</strong> and using the <strong>Rails</strong> framework, it was my very first project that involved web development. My role within the team was as the <strong>Algorithm Specialist</strong>.

                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-8">
                          <p>The idea behind the app was to make a system where users are rewarded by their respective house for doing chores.
                            We want to be able to group multiple users and also keep track of their individual chores.
                            Using <strong>postgreSQL</strong> as the back end of our choice, we ended up with a database consisting of about five different tables.
                          </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>This app allows housemates to form a rotation for chores that can repeat for certain intervals.
                              By utilizing a separate table for the rotation, I came up with simple algorithm that allowed us to keep track of the people who has and hasnt done that particular chore yet.
                              This allows for members to pass the task to another member in case they are unable to complete the task for certain reasons.

                            <p>We want users to be able to have fun with their chores through the social media aspect of this web app.
                              For that reason, we included some sort of news feed where all users can see the activities that occur in all the households registered within the app.
                              To be able to have the option to leave comments and share pictures regarding who did or did not a good job.
                              The app was launched onto <strong>Heroku</strong> by the end of the ten week period we had to develop it.
                              However due to time constraints and also the lack of experience before the project, we were unable to fully polish the application to what we envisioned it to be.
                              Nonetheless, it was a great experience that introduced me to the many things I can expect from software development.

                        <p>This project was made during a five week summer session of a multimedia design class. Implementation was not the focus of this project, but rather the overall design of an application.
                          This allowed me to be more creative on what features that I want to include into an application without having to worry about the finer details of implementation.
                          I worked with the a team of six members where I was mostly involved in deciding the overall <strong>user interface</strong>.

                          <p>Before we even decided on what our application is going to be, we started the first week coming up with a name and logo design for our team.
                            The name <strong>Fire Melon</strong> somehow just came up during our brainstroming process. Each of the members including myself came up with potential designs for our team logo.

                            <p>Up until the end of the second week involved our process of needfinding potential users for our application is supposed to be about.
                              We wanted our app to have a focus on productivity enhancement thus we conducted interviews with individuals ranging from college students to full-time workers.
                              From those interviews each members drew out storyboards on how our app could potentially help our potential users in their academic or even work life.
                              As someone who doodles on their free time, I myself had some fun drawing mini comic strips during this phase.
                              During this process we came up with one interesting feature our app should have - allowing users to generate a reminder task through their email inbox.

                            <p>We decided that our application will have features that many popular productivity applications have such listing tasks with deadline and a calendar to name a few.
                              For the next two weeks we began our prototyping phase where we decide how we will layout the features within the app.
                              Using the <strong>Balsamiq</strong> software to make our low-fidelity prototype, we were able to come up with prototypes that are ready for testing with great ease.
                              We were able to get feedback from our peers in the class from testing out our prototype, which helps us decide what to include in our final design.

                            <p>Things become a little more hectic towards the end. We had made the decision to use <strong>InVisionapp</strong> as the platform of choice for our final high fidelity prototype.
                              Putting my <strong>Photoshop</strong> experience to good use, this is where I did most of my contribution for the team.
                              While I was also able to assist my fellow teamates in learning photoshop, I also learned some new tricks for my own during the process.
                              I would say that our final design ended up with rather eyecatching aesthetic.

                              This project was a nice change of pace for me who is mostly used to projects that involved more coding.
                              I was able to actually applythe graphic design skills which I accumulated during my leisure and was really rewarded for doing so.
                              It gave me a little more of what I can expect from myself in future software development projects.
